:x: **Integration Tests failed !** [(more details)](###_URL_###)

Ensure your code build locally using: 
```
mvn clean install
```
Or just launch all tests : 
```
mvn surefire:test
```
To launch integration tests only : 
```
mvn surefire:test '-Dtest=org.eclipse.leshan.integration.tests.**,!**/Redis*.java' -DfailIfNoTests=false
```
Currently, some of our integration tests are flaky :unamused: ,so do not hesitate to re-run in case of failure.
